<h1>what's on your mind...</h1>	
<hr/>
<pre> 	<b><u>Faithless</u></b> To be yourself in a world 
	that is constantly trying to make you something else 
	is the greatest accomplishment.
	Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue 
	what they are.
	Our time is limited, so don’t waste it living 
	someone else’s life.</pre>
